  summary: Price Estimates
  description: |
    The Price Estimates endpoint returns an estimated price range
    for each product offered at a given location. The price estimate is
    provided as a formatted string with the full price range and the localized
    currency symbol.<br><br>The response also includes low and high estimates,
    and the [ISO 4217](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code for
    situations requiring currency conversion. When surge is active for a particular
    product, its surge_multiplier will be greater than 1, but the price estimate
    already factors in this multiplier.
